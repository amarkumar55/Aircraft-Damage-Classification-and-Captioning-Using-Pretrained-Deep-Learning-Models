### Aircraft Damage Classification and Captioning Using Pretrained Deep Learning Models

### Project Overview

    Aircraft damage inspection is a critical task for ensuring flight safety and maintaining structural integrity. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. This project presents an   
    automated deep learning pipeline that combines computer vision and natural language processing to classify aircraft damage and generate descriptive captions for damaged aircraft images.
 
    The system performs two complementary tasks:
    
    Damage Classification – Classifies aircraft damage into Dent or Crack using feature extraction from a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network.
    
    Damage Captioning & Summarization – Generates human-readable captions and summaries for aircraft damage images using a Transformer-based BLIP model, improving explainability and interpretability.
    
    This project demonstrates how deep learning can modernize aircraft inspection workflows, reduce manual effort, and support maintenance decision-making in the aviation industry.
